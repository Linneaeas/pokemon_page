/* 
This code defines a React functional component named PokemonList. This component takes a prop named pokemon, which is an array of Pokémon names. The component is responsible for rendering the list of Pokémon names that it receives through the pokemon prop.

1. import React from "react";: Imports the React module, which is required to create and work with React components.

2. export default function PokemonList({ pokemon }) {: This line exports the PokemonList component as the default export of the module. The component is defined as a JavaScript function that takes a single prop named pokemon.

3. The return statement starts the JSX code block that represents the component's UI.

4. {pokemon.map((p) => ( <div key={p}> {p} </div> ))}: This line uses the map function to iterate over each Pokémon name in the pokemon array. For each Pokémon name (p), it generates a <div> element. The key attribute is set to the Pokémon name (p), which helps React efficiently update and manage the list of elements. Inside the <div>, the Pokémon name is displayed using the curly braces {p}.

5. </div>: Closes the wrapping <div> element that contains the list of Pokémon names.

In summary, the PokemonList component is responsible for rendering a list of Pokémon names. It uses the map function to iterate over the provided pokemon array, and for each Pokémon name, it creates a <div> element that displays the name. The key attribute is used for React's internal management of the list's elements.
